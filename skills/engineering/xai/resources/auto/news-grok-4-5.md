Today, we're launching **Grok 4.5**, SpaceXAI's smartest model built to
excel at coding, agentic tasks, and knowledge work. It's our strongest
model ever and was trained alongside
[Cursor](https://cursor.com/blog/spacex-model-training).

## [Real-world engineering excellence](#real-world-engineering-excellence)

Grok 4.5 was trained on datasets spanning knowledge in coding, science,
engineering, and math. With both intelligent and efficient reasoning,
Grok 4.5 excels at real engineering tasks and exceeds comparable leading
models at these tasks.

## [Training Grok 4.5](#training-grok-45)

Grok 4.5 was trained across tens of thousands of NVIDIA GB300 GPUs, with
training and stability techniques designed for large-scale runs. Beyond
raw token volume, we invested heavily in data filtering and curation:
deduplication, quality scoring, and domain-focused selection so that the
data mixture stayed high-coverage and high-signal.

We scaled reinforcement learning with a strong focus on per-token
intelligence. Our RL training covers hundreds of thousands of tasks,
centered on multi-step software engineering and other technical work,
with automated and model-based grading. Our stack is built for highly
asynchronous training, so agentic rollouts can run for many hours while
learning continues across tens of thousands of GPUs. The result is more
intelligent and efficient reasoning on real engineering and agentic
tasks.

### Built with one prompt

Grok 4.5 is incredibly capable at coding, from challenging Rust and
C/C++ tasks to end-to-end app building from prompt to production. Below
are some examples built by the model with one prompt. Grok 4.5 is highly
proficient at creating well-designed, end-to-end functional apps even
with minimal specification.

## [Faster than flash models](#faster-than-flash-models)

Grok 4.5 is served at fast-model speeds of **80 TPS**. Combined with
twice greater token efficiency than the latest leading models at the
same tasks, the model delivers intelligent results to you more quickly
and at far lower costs.

## [Excels at Office work](#excels-at-office-work)

Grok 4.5 is now the default model in [Grok Build](https://x.ai/build).
In addition to its coding proficiency, Grok Build is capable of building
complex Excel models that involve research from the web, multi-sheet
formula use, and even leaves stickies or notes behind for future
reference.

In PowerPoint and Word, Grok 4.5 is similarly meticulous. The model is
capable of using native PowerPoint shapes to build complex diagrams,
designing intuitive slide content, and writing clear prose in Word.

## [Pricing](#pricing)

Grok 4.5 is delivered at an incredibly competitive cost compared to
other leading models. Grok 4.5 is priced at \$2 per million input tokens
and \$6 per million output tokens. The model also achieves roughly 2x
the token efficiency of comparable leading models, solving tasks in
under half the number of steps. Overall, Grok 4.5 delivers the highest
intelligence per unit of time and cost.
