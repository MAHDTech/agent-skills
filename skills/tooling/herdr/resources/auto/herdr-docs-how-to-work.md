# How to work with Herdr

Run Herdr where the work lives. Attach from wherever you are.

Herdr is a background session server plus one or more terminal clients.
Panes keep running in the server. Clients attach, detach, and render the
session.

## Local work

Start Herdr from the project directory:

```
herdr
```

Terminal window

Herdr starts or attaches to your local background session automatically.
You do not manage sockets. Run shells, servers, tests, and agents
normally inside panes.

Detach the client with `ctrl+b q`. Your panes keep running.

Reattach later:

```
herdr
```

Terminal window

If you want to end the session and stop its panes, stop the server:

```
herdr server stop
```

Terminal window

## Remote work through normal SSH

SSH to the machine that has the code and credentials, then run Herdr
there:

```
ssh you@serverherdr
```

Terminal window

This works like a terminal multiplexer. Your shell is remote. The Herdr
server is remote. The agents and panes run on the remote machine. Detach
with `ctrl+b q`, disconnect, then SSH back and run `herdr` again.

Use this path when you already live inside an SSH shell, when you are on
a phone or tablet SSH client, or when you want the simplest setup.

## Work from your phone

Herdr works on your phone without a mobile app or web dashboard. Install
any SSH client, connect to the machine where your agents run, and start
Herdr there:

```
ssh you@serverherdr
```

Terminal window

The same persistent Herdr session opens in your phone terminal. The TUI
adapts to narrow screens, so you can inspect agents, switch workspaces,
and check panes without leaving SSH.

On iPhone, apps like [moshi](https://getmoshi.app/) work well.

## Remote work from your local terminal

Attach through SSH without opening a shell first:

```
herdr --remote workboxherdr --remote ssh://you@server:2222
```

Terminal window

Your local Herdr acts as a thin client. It connects over SSH, starts or
attaches to the remote Herdr server, and streams the UI back to your
local terminal.

Use this path when you want the remote session to feel local. The client
runs on your machine, so local desktop features such as image clipboard
paste can be bridged to the remote server. If you SSH first and run
`herdr` on the server, Herdr runs entirely on that server and cannot
read your local desktop clipboard.

For repeat targets, put the host in your SSH config:

```
Host workbox  HostName server.example.com  User you  Port 2222
```

Then attach with:

```
herdr --remote workbox
```

Terminal window

## Which path to use

Use `herdr` for local work. Use `ssh you@server` then `herdr` when you
want Herdr to behave like tmux on that remote shell or when you are
using a phone SSH client. Use `herdr --remote <host>` when you want a
local thin client for a remote session, including local clipboard image
paste bridging.

direct terminal attach, and `--no-session`, see [Persistence and remote
access](https://herdr.dev/docs/persistence-remote/).
