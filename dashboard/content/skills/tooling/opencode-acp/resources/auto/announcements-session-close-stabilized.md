# Session Close is stabilized

> Announcement that the session/close method is now part of the stable ACP protocol.

**Published:** April 23, 2026

The [Session Close RFD](https://agentclientprotocol.com/rfds/session-close) has moved to Completed and the `session/close` method is stabilized.

When advertised via `sessionCapabilities.close`, Clients can now ask Agents to cancel any ongoing work for a session and free the resources associated with it, without having to terminate the whole ACP process. This lets long-running Clients keep memory, threads, and subprocesses under control as users accumulate sessions over time.

For the protocol documentation, see [Closing Active Sessions](https://agentclientprotocol.com/protocol/v1/session-setup#closing-active-sessions).
