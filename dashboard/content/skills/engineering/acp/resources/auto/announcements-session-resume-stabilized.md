# Session Resume is stabilized

> Announcement that the session/resume method is now part of the stable ACP protocol.

**Published:** April 22, 2026

The Session Resume RFD has moved to Completed and the `session/resume` method is stabilized.

Unlike `session/load`, `session/resume` reconnects clients to an existing session without replaying the conversation history. This is a simpler primitive for agents that can restore context but don't implement full history replay, and it gives proxies and adapters a foundation they can build `session/load` semantics on top of.

For the shipped protocol, see [Resuming Sessions](https://agentclientprotocol.com/protocol/v1/session-setup#resuming-sessions). For the design history, see the [Session Resume RFD](https://agentclientprotocol.com/rfds/session-resume).
