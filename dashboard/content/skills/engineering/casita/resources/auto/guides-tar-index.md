# Import a Tar Archive

> Stream a tar archive directly into a verified canonical filesystem graph.

The tar importer creates the same canonical filesystem object model as a filesystem import, without extracting untrusted paths to disk first. It accepts regular files, directories, symlinks, hard links, and old-GNU sparse files. PAX GNU sparse members are rejected because their logical expansion is not yet available in the underlying async tar reader.

## CLI

`import` detects a tar file from its first valid header; `import -i tar` also accepts `-` for standard input. The stream must already be decompressed; for example, use a decompressor pipeline for a `.tar.gz` input. The named root is installed only after the whole archive is validated.

```console
$ casita --repository ./cache import release.tar --root releases/current
$ gzip -cd release.tar.gz | casita --repository ./cache import -i tar - \
    --root releases/current
```

The command defaults to the same finite archive, entry, pathname, file-byte, total-file-byte, and sparse-expansion limits as `TarImportLimits`. Override them with `--tar-max-archive-bytes`, `--tar-max-entries`, `--tar-max-path-bytes`, `--tar-max-file-bytes`, `--tar-max-total-file-bytes`, and `--tar-max-sparse-expansion-bytes` for a stricter deployment policy.

File finalization is pipelined while the next tar body is read. At most 16 files are being copied, queued, finalized, or verified at once. Set `--tar-max-in-flight-files 1` for serial processing, or choose another positive limit to control the number of open writers. Archive parsing stays sequential; the importer does not buffer whole files. Compression and chunk hashing use the payload backend’s existing workers.

## Rust

`TarImport` accepts an already-decompressed asynchronous tar stream, so a `.tar.gz` or similar input must be decompressed before it reaches Casita. The root is published only after the complete archive has been validated and converted to a canonical directory graph.

```rust
use casita::{Repository, RootName, import::TarImport, TarImportLimits};
use tokio::io::BufReader;


let repository = Repository::local("./cache").await?;
let archive = tokio::fs::File::open("release.tar").await?;
let report = repository
    .import(
        TarImport::new(BufReader::new(archive), RootName::try_from("releases/current")?)
            .with_limits(TarImportLimits::default()),
    )
    .await?;


println!("{} entries in {}", report.entries, report.root);
```

`TarImportLimits` bounds archive bytes, entries, one file, total file bytes, sparse expansion, and in-flight files (`max_in_flight_files`, default 16). Set lower deployment-specific limits before accepting untrusted archives.
