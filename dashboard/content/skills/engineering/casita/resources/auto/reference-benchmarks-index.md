# Benchmarks

> Run and interpret Casita's reproducible performance suites.

The [benchmark harness](https://github.com/cachix/casita/tree/main/benchmarks) measures import, checkout, sync, verification, and collection. It also has focused suites for repository scale, Git history, catalog indexing, cache pressure, and network conditions. The [benchmark dashboard](/benchmarks/) shows published results.

Comparisons with Git, restic, Borg, and tar+zstd cover only operations the tools share. Their verification, retention, and storage semantics differ, so read the notes beside each result before comparing timings.

## Reproduce a run

From the pinned development environment, start with a short smoke run:

```console
$ devenv shell
$ benchmark --profile smoke \
    --implementations casita,git,tar-zstd \
    --cache-policies warm \
    --repetitions 1
```

Each timed sample gets a fresh repository. Setup and correctness checks happen outside the timing window. The runner checks restored file bytes, paths, executable bits, and symlink targets before accepting a sample.

For publication, use the [full command and workload matrix in the benchmark README](https://github.com/cachix/casita/blob/main/benchmarks/README.md#publication-run). It uses both cache policies, all comparators, at least ten repetitions, `--require-all`, and `--require-clean`. Raw JSON records the source revision, tool versions, environment, inputs, and individual samples. Keep that JSON with its generated Markdown report in `benchmarks/baselines/`.

To regenerate a report without rerunning a benchmark, use `benchmark --render-existing RESULT.json`. Exploratory output belongs in `benchmarks/results/`; `benchmark-dashboard` builds the public page from the selected results.

## Graph traversal and spill

`graph-traversal` measures verification and collection when traversal state spills to temporary SQLite databases:

```console
$ benchmark run graph-traversal --profile smoke --repetitions 1 \
    --output benchmarks/results/graph-traversal-smoke.json
```

The run records time, peak memory, spill size, and cleanup. Its correctness gate requires a forced spill and checks that temporary files are removed. See the [suite details](https://github.com/cachix/casita/blob/main/benchmarks/README.md#graph-traversal-and-spill) for the tested sizes and limits.

## Native Git scale

`git-scale` measures import and Git service operations across histories with many objects, deltas, large packs, and wide trees:

```console
$ benchmark run git-scale --profile smoke --shape many-objects
```

The optional huge profiles require a dedicated volume. Synthetic cases isolate individual costs; a real large repository provides a separate check. See the [Git scale suite](https://github.com/cachix/casita/blob/main/benchmarks/README.md#native-git-scale-suite).

## Catalog scale and S3 requests

`benchmark run catalog-index` measures catalog encoding, lookup, publication, reopening, and rebasing. It records memory, transferred bytes, and object-store requests. Its scale projections include request costs as well as catalog size. For current thresholds and assumptions, use the [catalog suite documentation](https://github.com/cachix/casita/blob/main/benchmarks/README.md#persistent-pack-index-benchmark).

## Retained history, cache pressure, and network limits

These suites test different sources of slowdown:

| Suite              | What it varies                                             |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `history-scale`    | Retained generations and small updates                     |
| `pack-cache-scale` | Working set size and read pattern against a bounded cache  |
| `network-scale`    | Latency and per-connection bandwidth for S3 and atomic RPC |

Run a bounded check with `benchmark run SUITE --profile smoke --repetitions 1`. The [suite documentation](https://github.com/cachix/casita/blob/main/benchmarks/README.md#history-cache-and-network-scale-matrix) explains the workloads, correctness checks, and limits of local network and cache measurements.
