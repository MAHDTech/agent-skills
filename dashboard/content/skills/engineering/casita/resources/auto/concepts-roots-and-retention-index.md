# Roots & Retention

> What keeps an object graph available and how roots change safely.

A `RootName` is a validated hierarchical name pointing to one `ObjectKey` in one repository. Setting or replacing a root commits a new repository revision. The root retains its target and every object reachable through verified forward links.

Removing a root makes that graph eligible for collection if no other root or active hold still needs it. Shared blobs and chunks remain while another live graph references them. Roots are permanent by default. On a local repository, an application can mark a root evictable for disk-pressure collection, which releases least recently used evictable roots when space is low. This is useful for rebuildable artifacts; Git histories and releases can remain permanent. The policy is repository metadata and does not change the root record’s frozen encoding.

## Active operations also retain data

Mutation sessions protect staged payloads until publication finishes or the session ends. A retention hold keeps the snapshot it read usable while other writers and collection proceed. Collection preserves these pinned lifetimes while removing unrelated garbage.

A snapshot hold covers records created through its metadata generation. It does not retain unrelated records published later. Creation generations are repository bookkeeping, not part of an object’s content identity. See [Garbage Collection](../garbage-collection/) for the full collection sequence.

## Conditional publication

`MutationSession::publish_if_roots_match` can publish staged objects and root changes only while every watched name still has its expected target, including expected absence. An unrelated state change is retried; a watched name change returns `RootMismatch` without publishing those logical changes.

This protects a service from overwriting a root that changed since it was read. The service still needs to control who may write its names. The check compares the current target, not the name’s full history: after removal, a delayed create may succeed again. To reject that replay, advance an owner fence root in the same commit. See [Share an S3 Repository Across Owners](../../guides/s3-multi-owner/) for an example.

Roots and revisions have meaning within one repository. `sync --root` installs the selected source value at the destination after verification; it does not order concurrent changes across repositories. Applications needing a merge policy must provide one.
